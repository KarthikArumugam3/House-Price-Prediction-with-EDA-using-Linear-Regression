# House-Price-Prediction-with-EDA-using-Linear-Regression
In this project I have created a model to predict the price of houses using Linear Regression.

# The model takes in input features as integer, where the input features are:-

1. housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building

2. totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block

3. totalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block

4. population: Total number of people residing within a block

5. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block

6. medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)

7. ocean_proximity_INLAND	: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

8. ocean_proximity_ISLAND	: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

9. ocean_proximity_NEAR BAY	: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

10. ocean_proximity_NEAR OCEAN	: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

11. ocean_proximity_<1H_OCEAN	: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea


# The target label:-
* median_house_value - Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)

After model creation I have also demonstarted if the use of Linear Regerssion for this dfataset was a good choice or not using metrics and residual plots.
